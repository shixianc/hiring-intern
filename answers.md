                     *Screenshot for my getSubString() function running as a Java Applet*

Algorithm: traversing the whole input string character by character. When finding a match on the first letter, program would call another private method *check()* to check if the match found. With multiple constraints, it would output the correct substring in between [fromString, toString]. Source code can be found in this repository!

I also convert it into a ***Zebra IDE*** Plugin and test and run on my localhost.
I build my Plugin by implementing LoadTestPluginInterface from library **dfischer.utils**
It teaches me a lot.  construct execute  deconstruct...
